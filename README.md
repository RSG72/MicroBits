The first step for me to create a remote control robot with two radio linked micro:bits. The Keyes Keyer-AD-Key K845037 is a 5 button (up, down, left, right, "fire") board.

This project for the BBC Micro:bit written in python is to move a dot around the screen using the Keyer-AD-Key K845037 board.
Version 2 will gamify the code to "capture" a randomly created pixel.
Version 3 will add a timer to the game.
