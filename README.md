This project is for the BBC Micro:bit and is written in python. 

This is the first stage for me to create a remote control robot with two radio linked micro:bits. 

The 1st stage will be to get the Keyes Keyer-AD-Key K845037 board interacting correctly with the Micro:bit. 
This is a 5 button (up, down, left, right, "fire") board.

Stage 2 will be for me to use and understand the radio function on the Micro:bit 
Stage 3 will be to get servos working on a Micro:bit 
Stage 4 will pull all the first three stages together to create a robot!!
