These are the first stages for me to create a remote control robot with two radio linked micro:bits. 
The 1st stage will be to get the Keyes Keyer-AD-Key K845037 board interacting correctly with the Micro:bit.
This is a 5 button (up, down, left, right, "fire") board.

This project for the BBC Micro:bit is written in python.
It will move a dot around the display using the Keyer-AD-Key K845037 board.
Version 2 will gamify the code to "capture" a randomly created pixel.
Version 3 will add a timer to the game.  

Stage 2 will be for me to use and understand the radio function on the Micro:bit 
Stage 3 will be to get servos working on a Micro:bit 
Stage 4 will pull all the first three stages together to create a robot!!
